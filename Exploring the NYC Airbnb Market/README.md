# Exploring the NYC Airbnb Market

 #### *Apply data importing and cleaning skills to extract insights about the New York City Airbnb market.*

  Our goals are to convert untidy data into appropriate formats to analyze, and answer key questions including:

 * 1. What is the average price, per night, of an Airbnb listing in NYC?
 * 2. How does the average price of an Airbnb listing, per month, compare to the private rental market?
 * 3. How many adverts are for private rooms?
 * 4. How do Airbnb listing prices compare across the five NYC boroughs?
